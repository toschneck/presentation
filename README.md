Setting up unit- and integration tests are tasks which developers have learned to deal. But  testing UIs from the perspective of an end user is mostly still a challenge. The key question usually to answer is: How it is possible to make these end-2-end tests stable, scalable and reproducible? The upcoming container technologies bring the hope of managing and automating your UI tests as easily as your container deployment. After a short introduction to the concepts, a live demo will show how it is possible to test a web- or a rich-client application in a containerized Linux UI. The example will be demonstrated by the open source tools __Docker__ and __Sakuli__. The execution and reporting of the tests will be managed by the continuous integration platform __Jenkins__, which brings the ability to integrate everything into your build pipeline.
